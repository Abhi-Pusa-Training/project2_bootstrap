      <h2><b>Scuba Diving</b></h2>
      <article>
        <p>
        Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving in which a scuba diver uses a self-contained
        underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) to breathe underwater.Unlike other modes of diving,
        which rely either on breath-hold or on breathing gas pumped from the surface, scuba divers
        carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air, allowing them greater
        freedom of movement than with an air line or diver's umbilical and longer underwater endurance
        than breath-hold. Scuba equipment may be open circuit, in which exhaled gas is expelled to the
        surroundings, or a closed or semi-closed circuit rebreather, in which the breathing gas is
        scrubbed to remove carbon dioxide, and the oxygen used is replenished from a supply of feed
        gas before being re-breathed.A scuba diver primarily moves underwater by using fins attached
        to the feet, but external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle,
        or a sled pulled from the surface.

        <p>
        Skim the waves. Surf the seas. Float across the skies. The fabulous golden Goan coast
        is sprinkled with water sports excitements from windsurfing to paragliding.
        John Lucas, an Englishman, who first came to Goa in the early 70s like thousands of
        other westerners on a spiritual journey, found his heaven here in Goa. Being a keen
        windsurfer, the next time he came back to Goa, he had with him, his board and rig.
        And the trend for water sports in Goa was set.
        Today there are a number of water based sports and activities available in Goa.
        the best season for enjoying water sports in Goa is from October to May when the skies
        here are cloudless and blue, and the waters fairly placid.

      <h2><b>Sky Diving<b></h2>
      <article>
      <p>
        Parachuting, or skydiving, is a method of exiting an aircraft and returning to Earth with
        the aid of gravity, then slowing down during the last part of the descent by using a parachute.
        It may involve more or less free-fall, a time during which the parachute has not been deployed
        and the body gradually accelerates to terminal velocity.Andre-Jacques Garnerin was the first
        to make successful descents using a canvas canopy from a small basket tethered beneath a hot-air
        balloon. The first intentional freefall jump with a ripcord-operated deployment is credited to Leslie Irvin in 1919.
        The military developed parachuting technology as a way to save aircrews from emergencies aboard
        balloons and aircraft in flight, and later as a way of delivering soldiers to the battlefield.
        Early competitions date back to the 1930s, and it became an international sport in 1952.

            <p>Goa is a state located in the South western region of India;
            it is bounded by the state of Maharashtra to the north, and by Karnataka to
            the east and south, while the Arabian Sea forms its western coast. It is India's
            smallest state by area and the fourth smallest by population. Goa is one of India's
            richest states with a GDP per capita two and a half times that of the country
            as a whole. It was ranked the best placed state by the Eleventh Finance Commission
            for its infrastructure and ranked on top for the best quality of life in India by
            the National Commission on Population based on the 12 Indicators.

            Panaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is the largest city. The historic
            city of Margao still exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first
            landed in the early 16th century as merchants and conquered it soon thereafter. Goa
            is a former Portuguese province; the Portuguese overseas territory of Portuguese
            India existed for about 450 years until it was annexed by India in 1961.

            Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year
            for its beaches, places of worship and world heritage architecture. It also has
            rich flora and fauna, owing to its location on the Western Ghats range, which is
            classified as a biodiversity hotspot.</p>
